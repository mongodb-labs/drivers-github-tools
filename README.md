# drivers-github-tools

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Repository is NOT a supported MongoDB product

This repository contains GitHub Actions that are common to drivers.

## Secure Checkout

This action will perform a checkout with the GitHub App credentials.

```yaml
- name: secure-checkout
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/secure-checkout@v2
  with:
    app_id: ${{ vars.APP_ID }}
    private_key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

By default it will use the current `${{github.ref}}` if the `ref` parameter is
not given.  It will write the secure global variable `GH_TOKEN` that can be
used with the `gh` cli.


## Setup

There is a common setup action that is meant to be run before all
other actions.  It handles fetching secrets from AWS Secrets Manager,
signing into Artifactory, setting up Garasign credentials, and
setting up environment variables used in other actions.
The action requires `id-token: write` permissions.

```yaml
- name: setup
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/setup@v2
  with:
    aws_role_arn: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_ARN }}
    aws_region_name: ${{ vars.AWS_REGION_NAME }}
    aws_secret_id: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ID }}
```

> [!Note]
> You *must* use the `actions/checkout` action prior to calling the `setup` action,
> Since the `setup` action sets up git config that would be overridden by the
> `actions/checkout action`
>
> The following keys MUST be defined in the ``AWS_SECRET_ID`` vault:
> `artifactory-username`, `artifactory-password`, `garasign-username`
> `garasign-password`, `gpg-key-id`.  If uploading to an S3 bucket, also define
> `release-assets-bucket`.

## Signing tools

These actions are used to sign artifacts using the team's GPG key.

### git-sign

Use this action to create signed git artifacts:

```yaml
- name: Setup
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/setup@v2
  with:
    ...

- name: Create signed commit
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/git-sign@v2
  with:
    command: "git commit -m 'Commit' -s --gpg-sign=${{ env.GPG_KEY_ID }}"

- name: Create signed tag
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/git-sign@v2
  with:
    command: "git tag -m 'Tag' -s --local-user=${{ env.GPG_KEY_ID }} -a <tag>"
```

### bump-version

This is a convenience action to bump the version, create a signed commit, and
push the commit unless `push_commit` is disabled.  You can override the commit message
format if desired.  The version bump script should accept a new version as
an argument and update the version accordingly.

```yaml
- name: Bump version
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/bump-version@v2
  with:
    version: ${{ inputs.version }}
    version_bump_script: "bash ./my-bump-version-script.sh"
```

### tag-version

This is a convenience action to create a signed tag, optionally verify the tag,
and push the tag unless `push_tag` is disabled.  You can override the tag format and the
tag message format if desired.

```yaml
- name: Tag version
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/tag-version@v2
  with:
    version: ${{ inputs.version }}
```

### gpg-sign

This action is used to create detached signatures for files:

```yaml
- name: Setup
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/setup@v2
  with:
    ...

- name: Create detached signature
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/gpg-sign@v2
  with:
    filenames: somefile.ext
```

The action will create a signature file `somefile.ext.sig` in the working
directory.

You can also supply a glob pattern to sign a group of files:

```yaml
- name: Setup
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/setup@v2
  with:
    ...

- name: Create detached signature
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/garasign/gpg-sign@v1
  with:
    filenames: dist/*
```

## Reporting tools

The following tools are meant to aid in generating Software Security Development Lifecycle
reports associated with a product release.

### Authorized Publication

This action will create a record of authorized publication on distribution channels.
It will create the file `$S3_ASSETS/authorized_publication.txt`

```yaml
- name: Setup
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/setup@v2
  with:
    ...

- name: Create Authorized Publication Report
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/authorized-pub@v2
  with:
    product_name: Mongo Python Driver
    release_version: ${{ github.ref_name }}
    filenames: dist/*
    token: ${{ github.token }}
```

### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

This action will download an Augmented SBOM file in `$RELEASE_ASSETS/sbom.json`.

```yaml
- name: Setup
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/setup@v2
  with:
    ...

- name: Create SBOM
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/sbom@v2
  with:
    silk_asset_group: mongodb-python-driver
```

### Code Scanning Alerts

This action will export all dismissed and open alerts to a SARIF file. By
default, this file is named `code-scanning-alerts.json` and placed in the
working directory.

```yaml
- name: Setup
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/setup@v2
  with:
    ...

- name: Export Code Scanning Alerts
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/code-scanning-export@v2
```

### Compliance Report

This action will generate the SSDLC compliance report in the `S3_ASSETS` folder,
called `ssdlc_compliance_report.md`.

```yaml
- name: Setup
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/setup@v2
  with:
    ...

- name: Generate compliance report
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/compliance-report@v2
```

There are several ways to specify the security report:
- By specifying an absolute URL starting with https
- By specifying a relative path, which is then linked to the corresponding git blob for the tagged version
- By adding the `security-report-url` to the AWS Secrets Vault

## Full Report

This action is a convenience function to handle all of the SSDLC reports and put them
in the `S3_ASSETS` folder. This composite action runs the `authorized-pub`, `sbom`, `code-scanning-export`, and `compliance-report` actions.

```yaml
- name: Setup
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/setup@v2
  with:
    ...

- name: Generate SSDLC Reports
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/full-report@v2
  with:
    product_name: winkerberos
    release_version: ${{ inputs.version }}
    silk_asset_group: winkerberos
    dist_filenames: dist/*
```

## Upload S3 assets

A number of scripts create files in the `tmp/s3_assets` folder, which then can
be uploaded to the product's S3 bucket:

```yaml
- name: Setup
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/setup@v2
  with:
    ...

- name: Upload S3 assets
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/upload-s3-assets@v2
  with:
    version: <release version>
    product_name: <product_name>
```

Optionally, you can specify which files to upload using the `filenames` input.
By default, all files in the S3 directory are uploaded. When the `dry_run` input
is set to anything other than `false`, no files are uploaded, but instead the
filename along with the resulting location in the bucket is printed.

## Create Release Branch

Use this action to create a release branch and populate it with metadata.
It will create a new Silk Asset Group, update the SBOM-lite file,
update the ``SILK_ASSET_GROUP`` and ``EVERGREEN_PROJECT`` env variables
in the release workflow file, bump the version to a
prerelease version, and push the changes.

> [!Note]
> You will need to wait overnight before making a release on
> the new branch to allow Silk to be populated, so it is recommended to
> make a minor/major release prior to creating a release branch, or create the
> release branch at least one day before a planned release.

```yaml
- name: Setup
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/setup@v2
  with:
    ...

- name: Create Release Branch
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/create-branch@v2
  with:
    # user inputs
    branch: ...
    version: ...
    base_ref: <optional>
    push_changes: <whether to push changes>
    # other inputs
    version_bump_script: <path/to/version/bump/script>
    evergreen_project: <name of evergreen release project>
```

## Python Helper Scripts

These scripts are opinionated helper scripts for Python releases.

### Pre-Publish

Bump the version and create a new tag.  Verify the tag.
Push the commit and tag to the source branch unless `dry_run` is set.

```yaml
- name: Setup
  uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/setup@v2
  with:
    ...

- uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/python/pre-publishv2
  with:
    version: ${{ inputs.version }}
    version_bump_script: ./.github/scripts/bump-version.sh
    dry_run: ${{ inputs.dry_run }}
```

### Post-publish

To be run after separately publishing the [Python package](https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish#trusted-publishing).
Handles follow-up tasks related to publishing Python packages, including
signing `dist` files and uploading report assets to S3.
It will also push the following (dev) version to the source branch.
It will create a draft GitHub release and attach the signature files.
If `dry_run` is set, nothing will be pushed.

The jobs should look something like:

```yaml
publish:
  name: Upload release to PyPI
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: release
  permissions:
    id-token: write
  steps:
    - name: Download all the dists
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: all-dist-${{ github.run_id }}
        path: dist/
    - name: Publish package distributions to PyPI
      if: inputs.dry_run == 'false'
      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1

post-publish:
  needs: [publish]
  name: Handle post-publish actions
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: release
  permissions:
    id-token: write
    contents: write
    attestations: write
    security-events: write
  steps:
  - name: Setup
    uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/setup@v2
    with:
      ...

  - uses: mongodb-labs/drivers-github-tools/python/post-publish@v2
    with:
      version: ${{ inputs.version }}
      following_version: ${{ inputs.following_version }}
      version_bump_script: ./.github/scripts/bump-version.sh
      product_name: winkerberos
      token: ${{ github.token }}
      dry_run: ${{ inputs.dry_run }}
```
